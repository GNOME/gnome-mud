  <sect1 id="intro">
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
     <application>GNOME-Mud</application> is an specialized telnet
     client to play Multi-User Dungeons, or MUDs.
    </para>
    <para>
     Multi-User Dungeons are imaginary worlds and realms that exist on
     the Internet, where people connect and can perform a variety of
     actions. A MUD can be thought of a chat forum with a space
     dimension, as the users can move around and interact with other
     users and the artifacts they find in each location. In a typical
     mud, players can communicate and fight each other, use magic, trade,
     travel to new zones, resolve quizzes (also called quests), and become
     part of communities like guilds, orders, etc. The environment also
     varies between MUDs, but the most common are ambiented in fantasy
     worlds, similar to those described by Tolkien's `Lord of the Rings'
     or Dungeons and Dragons. Classic MUDs are text-based, and can be
     accessed through a simple `telnet' connection; the user inputs orders
     to the MUD server, and the server replies with the result of the action.
    </para>
    <para>
    There are hundreds of MUDs available on the Internet, but there are some
    sites that classify them and provide with detailed MUD lists, often
    provided by the MUD maintainers.
    <ulink url="http://www.mudconnect.com/" type="http">MudConnect.com</ulink>
    is one of them, and GNOME-Mud has native support for their mudlist format.
    </para>
    <para>
     <application>GNOME-Mud</application> provides the user with a series
     of functionality that makes mudding somewhat easier. Most notably, the
     ability to define `triggers', `aliases' and `character profiles', or
     the MUD lists support help making usual tasks like connecting to
     different MUDs and typing common names or commands more effective
     and fast.
    </para>
    <para>
      To run <application>GNOME-Mud</application>, select
      <menuchoice>
	<guisubmenu>Games</guisubmenu>

 <!-- ================ Usage ================================ -->
 <!-- This section should describe basic usage of the application. -->

  <sect1 id="usage">
    <title>Using GNOME-Mud</title>
    <para>
      <application>GNOME-Mud</application> can be used to play any kind
      of telnet-based MUDs, and should make mudding easier, both for
      players and coders. It can connect to various MUDs on the same
      application window, and load different settings depending on the
      character you're logging in. <application>GNOME-Mud</application>'s
      goal is to provide a similar client to
      <ulink url="http://www.zuggsoft.com/zmud/zmudinfo.htm" type="http">
      zMUD</ulink>, a very mature MUD client for the Windows platform.
    </para>

    <!-- ========= Basic Usage =========================== -->
    <sect2 id="mainwin">
      <title>Basic usage</title>
      <para>
        Starting <application>GNOME-Mud</application> opens the
        <interface>Main window</interface>, shown in <xref
        linkend="main-window">. The window is at first mostly empty, just
	showing some information about the
	<application>GNOME-Mud</application> build you're running.

	    srccredit="Jordi Mallach">

	</figure>
      </para>


 <!-- For this app, one could put "proving" or "edit" (probably even
      both of them) as sect2's separate from the main window
      section. Since they were both so closely involved with the main
      window, I decided to have them as sect3's instead. Judgment
      call. -->

      <sect3 id="connecting">
	<title>Connecting to a MUD</title>
	<para>
          To connect to a MUD, select
          <menuchoice>
	    <guisubmenu>File</guisubmenu>
	    <guimenuitem>Connection Wizard...</guimenuitem>
	  </menuchoice>,
          which will bring up the
	  <interface>GNOME-Mud Connections</interface> dialog box.
	  The <interface>Connection Wizard</interface> allows you to
	  create different connections so you can store a list of
	  "personalities".
	  <figure id="connections-window">
	   <title>GNOME-Mud Connection Wizard</title>
	   <screenshot>
	    <screeninfo>GNOME-Mud Connection Wizard</screeninfo>
	    <graphic fileref="figures/connections-window.png" format="png"
	    srccredit="Jordi Mallach">
	   </screenshot>
	  </figure>
	  To create a connection, enter a descriptive title (normally the
	  MUD's full name) in the <guilabel>Title</guilabel> field and fill
	  in the MUD's information in the <guilabel>Host</guilabel> and
	  <guilabel>Port</guilabel> fields (leaving <guilabel>Port</guilabel>
	  blank will make it default to port 23). You can also import those
	  fields very easily using the <link linkend="mudlist">
	  <interface>GNOME-Mud MudList</interface></link> and selecting a MUD
	  from there. Enter the character information in the
	  <guilabel>Character</guilabel> and <guilabel>Password</guilabel>
	  (password is only required if you want to autolog into the MUD).
	  If you want to bind the connection to a set of aliases, triggers,
	  variables keybinds, click on <guibutton>Select Profile</guibutton>
	  and select the desired one from the list. See the section on
	  <link linkend="profiles"><interface>Profiles</interface></link>
	  for more information on them. Once you have filled all the fields,
	  press <guibutton>Apply</guibutton> to accept the values of the new
	  profile or to update them, in case a profile with the same
	  <guilabel>title</guilabel> already existed, or <guibutton>Cancel
	  </guibutton> to discard them. When a connection is
	  created, it will show up in the left column of the dialog, showing
	  the MUD title and  character name. Select the desired connection
	  and press <guibutton>Connect</guibutton> to start the connection.
	  <guibutton>Close</guibutton> will close the <interface>Connection
	  Wizard</interface>.
        </para>
	<para>
	  Alternatively, you can quickly connect to a MUD, bypassing the
	  connection wizard selecting
	  <menuchoice>
	    <guisubmenu>File</guisubmenu>
	    <guimenuitem>Connect...</guimenuitem>
	  </menuchoice>,
	  which will bring up the <interface>Quick Connect</interface> dialog.
	  Just fill in the <guilabel>Host</guilabel> and <guilabel>Port
	  </guilabel> fields and press <guibutton>OK</guibutton> to connect
	  to the desired MUD.
	</para>
	<para>
	  If you open various connections simultaneously, <application>
	  GNOME-Mud</application> will place them inside <interface>connection
	  tabs</interface>, which will appear below the connection screen.
	  To close a tab after disconnecting from a MUD, select
	  <menuchoice>
	    <guisubmenu>File</guisubmenu>
	    <guimenuitem>Close Window</guimenuitem>
	  </menuchoice>
	  and the tab will disappear.
	</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="mudlist">
        <title>MudList support</title>
	<para>
	 <application>GNOME-Mud</application> can read
	 <ulink url="http://www.mudconnect.com/" type="http">
	 MudConnect.com</ulink>'s MUD list, which is an extensive list of
	 MUDs, with information about their codebase, host, port and including
	 a description. There are two ways to use the <interface>GNOME-Mud
	 MudList</interface>.
	 <figure id="mudlist-window">
	  <title>GNOME-Mud MudList</title>
	  <screenshot>
	   <screeninfo>GNOME-Mud MudList</screeninfo>
	   <graphic fileref="figures/mudlist-window.png" format="png"
	   srccredit="Jordi Mallach">
	  </screenshot>
	 </figure>
	</para>
	<para>
	 The most common way is probably by opening it
	 from the <link linkend="connecting"><interface>Connection Wizard
	 </interface></link>. This will open the <interface>GNOME-Mud Mudlist
	 </interface> in "import mode". You will find a list of MUDs at the
	 left column of the dialog, ordered by codebase. If you expand a
	 codebase, you'll get a list of the MUDs in that section. Click on
	 a MUD to see the information displayed in the right side of the
	 <interface>MudList</interface>.<guilabel>Mud Name</guilabel> is the
	 full name of the MUD, <guilabel>Telnet Address</guilabel> is the host
	 and port where it is located and <guilabel>Codebase</guilabel>
	 describes what type of MUD it is. <guilabel>Description</guilabel>
	 shows a more or less description of the selected MUD.
	 In "import mode", there will be a <guibutton>Import and close
	 </guibutton> button, which will fetch the MUD info and fill it into
	 a new connection in the <interface>Connection Wizard</interface>.
	 There's also a <guibutton>Go to webpage of the MUD</guibutton> button,
	 which will point a web browser to the webpage defined in the mud list.
	</para>
	<para>
	 Another way of using the MudList is exactly the opposite. Select
	 <menuchoice>
	   <guisubmenu>File</guisubmenu>
	   <guimenuitem>MudList Listing...</guimenuitem>
	 </menuchoice>
	 and you'll get the same dialog as if opened from the
	 <interface>Connection Wizard</interface>, only the <guibutton>Import
	 and close</guibutton> button will be replaced by <guibutton>Connect
	 to the mud</guibutton>.
	</para>

      <sect3 id="disconnecting">
        <title>Disconnecting from MUDs</title>
	<para>
	  To disconnect from a MUD, you should try to use your MUD's logout
	  command. Normally this command is <command>quit</command> or
	  <command>rent</command>, but it can vary across MUD flavours.
	  <application>GNOME-Mud</application> can "hard-disconnect" from a
	  mud, using
	  <menuchoice>
	    <guisubmenu>File</guisubmenu>
	    <guimenuitem>Disconnect</guimenuitem>
	  </menuchoice>,
	  or just quitting from <application>GNOME-Mud</application>.
	</para>
	<warning>
	  <title>Warning on hard-disconnects</title>
	  <para>
	  It is very desirable that you disconnect from MUDs using the MUD's
	  own logout procedures. Some MUDs have retarded quit commands to
	  avoid people escaping from death during fights, so you need to wait
	  some seconds or minutes since you send the quit command till you
	  actually quit. If you hard-disconnect using <application>
	  GNOME-Mud</application>'s <interface>Disconnect</interface>, you
	  may stay in the MUD for a while, idling and uncontrolled, while
	  the MUD locks you in or it realizes you have lost your connection.
	  This could be dangerous, as other players could take advantage
	  of your idling to kill you or steal your possessions, for example.
	  </para>
	</warning>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="profiles">
	<title>Editing Profiles</title>
	<para>
	  Normally, each character class has different commands and abilities
	  which require different configurations for the mudding session.
	  Using <interface>Profiles</interface>, you can customize different
	  features of <application>GNOME-Mud</application> to suit the
	  current character's needs.
	  To edit them, select <guibutton>Profiles</guibutton> from the
	  toolbar, and a dialog with a list of customizable items will appear.

		  insert an shortcut in the <guilabel>Alias</guilabel> field,
		  and the desired expanded command in the <guilabel>
		  Replacement </guilabel> field. Clicking on <guibutton>
		  Add</guibutton> will add or modify the edited alias and
		  add it to the alias list. For example, filling in
		  <guilabel>Alias</guilabel> with "wd" and <guilabel>
		  Replacement</guilabel> with "who drow" will make
		  <application>GNOME-Mud</application> send the "who drow"
		  command to the MUD when the user issues a "wd" command in

		  to "You are being attacked" and <guilabel>Trigger</guilabel>
		  to "<command>flee</command>", you will try to escape as soon

 <!-- ============= Various Sections ============================= -->

 <!-- Here you should add, if necessary, several more sect1's,
 describing other windows (besides the main one), file formats,
 preferences dialogs,  etc. as appropriate. Try not to make any of
 these sections too long. -->


 <!-- ============= Bugs ================================== -->
 <!-- This section should describe known bugs and limitations of
      the program if there are any - please be frank and list all
      problems you know of. -->
 <sect1 id="bugs">
  <title>Known Bugs and Limitations</title>
  <para>
   GNOME-Mud will crash on some MUDs when MCCP (MUD Client Compression
   Protocol) is compiled in. If you're playing in a LP MUD, it is recommended
   to <emphasis>disable MCCP support</emphasis>.
  </para>
  <para>
   8bit characters are sent correctly to the MUD but aren't shown well in
   the connection window.
  </para>
  <para>
   Some colors are bad defined. For example, yellow shows as dark blue and
   bold black doesn't show at all.
  </para>
  <para>
   Command history search won't show the last command when you press
   the up-arrow key, but the command before the last.
  </para>
  <para>
   The mapping support is still limited and must be used manually (you can't
   map as you walk through the MUD).
  </para>
  <para>
   And of course, there are no plugins available yet!
