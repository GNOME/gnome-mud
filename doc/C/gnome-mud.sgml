    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
     <application>GNOME-Mud</application> is an specialized telnet
     client to play Multi-User Dungeons, or MUDs.
    </para>
    <para>
     Multi-User Dungeons are imaginary worlds and realms that exist in
     the Internet, where people connect and can perform a variety of
     actions. A MUD can be thought of a chat forum with a space
     dimension, as the users can move around and interact with other
     users and the artifacts they find in each location. In a typical
     mud, players can communicate and fight each other, use magic, trade,
     travel to new zones, resolve quizzes (also called quests), and become
     part of communities like guilds, orders, etc. The environment also
     varies between MUDs, but the most common are ambiented in fantasy
     worlds, similar to those described by Tolkien's `Lord of the Rings'
     or Dungeons and Dragons. Classic MUDs are text-based, and can be
     accessed through a simple `telnet' connection; the user inputs orders
     to the MUD server, and the server replies with the result of the action.
    </para>
    <para>
     <application>GNOME-Mud</application> provides the user with a series
     of functionality that makes mudding somewhat easier. Most notably, the
     ability to define `triggers', `aliases' and `character profiles' help
     making usual tasks like connecting to different MUDs and typing common
     names or commands more effective and fast.
    </para>
    <para>
      To run <application>GNOME-Mud</application>, select
      <menuchoice>
	<guisubmenu>Games</guisubmenu>

 <!-- ================ Usage ================================ -->
 <!-- This section should describe basic usage of the application. -->

  <sect1 id="usage">
    <title>Using GNOME-Mud</title>
    <para>
      <application>GNOME-Mud</application> can be used to play any kind
      of telnet-based MUDs, and should make mudding easier, both for
      players and coders. It can connect to various MUDs on the same
      application window, and load different settings depending on the
      character you're logging in. <application>GNOME-Mud</application>'s
      goal is to provide a similar client to
      <ulink url="http://www.zuggsoft.com/zmud/zmudinfo.htm" type="http">
      zMUD</ulink>, a very mature MUD client for the Windows platform.
    </para>

    <sect2 id="mainwin">
      <title>Basic usage</title>
      <para>
        Starting <application>GNOME-Mud</application> opens the

 <!-- For this app, one could put "proving" or "edit" (probably even
      both of them) as sect2's separate from the main window
      section. Since they were both so closely involved with the main
      window, I decided to have them as sect3's instead. Judgment
      call. -->

      <sect3 id="connecting">
	<title>Connecting to a MUD</title>
	<para>
          To connect to a MUD, select
          <menuchoice>
	    <guisubmenu>File</guisubmenu>
	    <guimenuitem>Connection Wizard...</guimenuitem>
	  </menuchoice>,
          which will bring up the
	  <interface>GNOME-Mud Connections</interface> dialog box.
	  The <interface>Connection Wizard</interface> allows you to
	  create different connections so you can store a list of
	  "personalities". To create a connection, enter a descriptive
	  title (such as Mudname - Character) in the
	  <guilabel>Title</guilabel> field and fill in the MUD's information
	  in the <guilabel>Host</guilabel> and <guilabel>Port</guilabel>
	  fields (leaving <guilabel>Port</guilabel> blank will make it
	  default to port 23). Enter the character information in the
	  <guilabel>Character</guilabel> and <guilabel>Password</guilabel>
	  (password is only required if you want to autolog into the MUD).
	  If you want to bind the connection to a set of aliases, triggers,
	  variables keybinds, click on <guibutton>Select Profile</guibutton>
	  and select the desired one from the list. See the section on
	  <link linkend="profiles"><interface>Profiles</interface></link>
	  for more information on them. Once you have filled all the fields,
	  press <guibutton>Apply</guibutton> to accept the values of the new
	  profile or to update them, in case a profile with the same
	  <guilabel>title</guilabel> already existed, or <guibutton>Cancel
	  </guibutton> to discard them. When a connection is
	  created, it will show up in the left column of the dialog, showing
	  the MUD title and  character name. Select the desired connection
	  and press <guibutton>Connect</guibutton> to start the connection.
	  <guibutton>Close</guibutton> will close the <interface>Connection
	  Wizard</interface>.
        </para>
	<para>
	  Alternatively, you can quickly connect to a MUD, bypassing the
	  connection wizard selecting
	  <menuchoice>
	    <guisubmenu>File</guisubmenu>
	    <guimenuitem>Connect...</guimenuitem>
	  </menuchoice>,
	  which will bring up the <interface>Quick Connect</interface> dialog.
	  Just fill in the <guilabel>Host</guilabel> and <guilabel>Port
	  </guilabel> fields and press <guibutton>OK</guibutton> to connect
	  to the desired MUD.
	</para>
	<para>
	  If you open various connections simultaneously, <application>
	  GNOME-Mud</application> will place them inside <interface>connection
	  tabs</interface>, which will appear below the connection screen.
	  To close a tab after disconnecting from a MUD, select
	  <menuchoice>
	    <guisubmenu>File</guisubmenu>
	    <guimenuitem>Close Window</guimenuitem>
	  </menuchoice>
	  and the tab will disappear.
	</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="disconnecting">
        <title>Disconnecting from MUDs</title>
	<para>
	  To disconnect from a MUD, you should try to use your MUD's logout
	  command. Normally this command is <command>quit</command> or
	  <command>rent</command>, but it can vary across MUD flavours.
	  <application>GNOME-Mud</application> can "hard-disconnect" from a
	  mud, using
	  <menuchoice>
	    <guisubmenu>File</guisubmenu>
	    <guimenuitem>Disconnect</guimenuitem>
	  </menuchoice>,
	  or just quitting from <application>GNOME-Mud</application>.
	</para>
	<warning>
	  <title>Warning on hard-disconnects</title>
	  <para>
	  It is very desirable that you disconnect from MUDs using the MUD's
	  own logout procedures. Some MUDs have retarded quit commands to
	  avoid people escaping from death during fights, so you need to wait
	  some seconds or minutes since you send the quit command till you
	  actually quit. If you hard-disconnect using <application>
	  GNOME-Mud</application>'s <interface>Disconnect</interface>, you
	  may stay in the MUD for a while, idling and uncontrolled, while
	  the MUD locks you in or it realizes you have lost your connection.
	  This could be dangerous, as other players could take advantage
	  of your idling to kill you or steal your possessions, for example.
	  </para>
	</warning>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="profiles">
	<title>Editing Profiles</title>
	<para>
	  Normally, each character class has different commands and abilities
	  which require different configurations for the mudding session.
	  Using <interface>Profiles</interface>, you can customize different
	  features of <application>GNOME-Mud</application> to suit the
	  current character's needs.
	  To edit them, select <guibutton>Profiles</guibutton> from the
	  toolbar, and a dialog with a list of customizable items will appear.

	      <term>Aliases</term>
	      <listitem>
		<para>
		  Aliases are similar to UNIX shell aliases. Pressing on the
		  button will open an alias editor. On the top of the dialog,
		  there is a list of defined aliases, and beneath it there are
		  two fields to insert new values. To create a new alias,
		  insert an shortcut in the <guilabel>Alias</guilabel> field,
		  and the desired expanded command in the <guilabel>
		  Replacement </guilabel> field. Clicking on <guibutton>
		  Add</guibutton> will add or modify the edited alias and
		  add it to the alias list. For example, filling in
		  <guilabel>Alias</guilabel> with "wd" and <guilabel>
		  Replacement</guilabel> with "who drow" will make
		  <application>GNOME-Mud</application> send the "who drow"
		  command to the MUD when the user issues a "wd" command in
		  the input line. You can get rid of unwanted aliases by
		  selecting it and clicking on <guibutton>Delete</guibutton>.
		  Exit the alias editor with the <guibutton>Close</guibutton>
		  button.

	      <term>Variables</term>
	      <listitem>
		<para>
		  Variables are useful to replace things within <interface>
		  Triggers</interface> or <interface>Variables</interface>.
		  For example, if you have defined a trigger with a nick in
		  it, you can use a variable instead of specifying the nick,
		  so you just need to change the variable value to apply the
		  trigger to another nick.
		</para>

		    This feature is very limited at the moment and should be
		    extended in future <application>GNOME-Mud</application>

	    <varlistentry>
	      <term>Triggers</term>
	      <listitem>
		<para>
		  Triggers are a very useful feature. When you define an
		  <guilabel>Action</guilabel> and bind a <guilabel>Trigger
		  </guilabel> to it, <application>GNOME-Mud</application> will
		  execute the trigger when it detects that the action has
		  occured. For example, setting <guilabel>Action</guilabel>
		  to "You are being attacked" and <guilabel>Trigger</guilabel>
		  to "<command>flee</command>", you will try to escape as soon
		  as you get hit by an enemy. Please note that some MUDs
		  consider any kind of automation as <emphasis>cheating
		  </emphasis>, so ask the MUD staff about this before using it.

		<para>
		  Keybinds perform commands when you activate a key sequence
		  or combination. You need to insert a keybind in the
		  <guilabel>Bind</guilabel> field and the command to be sent
		  in <guilabel>Command</guilabel>. You can insert binds more
		  easily using the <guibutton>Capture</guibutton>. When
		  pressed, it will capture the next key combination that you
		  press on the keyboard and insert it in the <guilabel>Bind
		  </guilabel> field.
		  Keybinds are useful for many things, for example, "speed
		  walking". If you bind "Up" to the "north" command, you will
		  be able to walk north just pressing the "Up Arrow" key.
