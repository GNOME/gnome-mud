BUGS - hopefully none :)
========================

1. It may crash with this message:
    ** ERROR **: file gtktext.c: line XXXX (advance_mark_n): "n > 0"

   This is something with the GTK+, I've saw this occasionally in 1.0.4
and 1.1.1. Best is to use >= 1.0.5 or 1.1.2 depending if you are using
development GTK or not.
