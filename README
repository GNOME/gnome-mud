AMCL = A simple Mud CLient

1. What is it?

    It is a client for connecting to MUD's (Multi User Dungeon), written
for X-Windows using the the GIMP ToolKit (GTK+). Some code used from 
Bezerk, Xwhois, LinPopUp.

    Latest version of AMCL can always be found at
    <URL:http://www.localhost.nu/apps/amcl/>

2. Requirements

    A c-compiler :), and the GTK+ (the GIMP ToolKit) which can be found
at ftp://ftp.gimp.org/pub/gtk. AMCL requires the newest version of GTK+,
currently 1.2.X due to bugs in the text widget.

    AMCL has been reported to compile and run on the following platforms,
if you have a platform not included here, send me a mail to report.

    - Linux 2.0, 2.1, 2.2
    - FreeBSD 3.x-STABLE

    - GTK+ 1.2.4, 1.2.6

3. Compiling

    Fastest way to do it:
	
    ./configure --help
    ./configure
    make
    strip src/amcl (if you want a smaller binary)
    make install (optional, just copy it if you don't want to install)

4. Problems.

    Mail me <lobbin@localhost.nu>. If this is a runtime bug, please 
include information about how I can reproduce the bug. Also include your
version of GTK+.

  * The version of GTK+     - gtk-config --version

    If it was a compiling bug, please include the following:

  * The version of GTK+     - gtk-config --version
  * System type/version     - uname -a
  * Output of ./configure   - ./configure > temp-config.txt
